# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.

#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#

group :jekyll_plugins do
  # GitHub Pages is used to ensure a very stable environment
  # with lots of pre-tested plugins.
  gem "github-pages"

  gem "jekyll-last-modified-at"
  gem "jekyll-netlify"
